Madden Dam began construction in *February 1932* and was completed in *1935*. The idea of its construction was conceived in *April 1928* by the American committee of administration of the **Panama Canal** formed by:

1. R. Z. Kirkpatrick
2. Geo. W. Green
3. A. C. Carrington
4. E. S. Randolph.[1]

It was built by damming the **Chagres River** (Panama's largest river) in its upstream section, completely flooding the community of Alhajuela and creating the Alhajuela or Madden Lake. The surface area of this lake is approximately 50 km2. 

The main objective of the construction of this dam is to ensure the water capacity of the Panama Canal during the dry season (January - April) and the production of electricity. [2]

## *Gatún Dam*

Built between *1907* and *1913*. It was the first dam built in the **Panama Canal** basin. Major George Washington Goethals, the chief engineer of most of the work, was the one who made the first investigations and suggestions for its construction.

The Gatún Dam has two parallel walls of 366 meters each, whose material comes mainly from Corte Culebra (narrowest section of the **Panama Canal**). To ensure its impermeability, the inside of the dam was filled with clay.[3]

It was built primarily to ensure the navigability of ships through the Panama Canal, while electricity generation and drinking water supply were not important objectives. It has an area of 420 km2. [2]
